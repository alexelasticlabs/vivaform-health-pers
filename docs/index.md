# VivaForm — Documentation Index

This is the main documentation index for developers and product owners. It contains links to the most relevant docs and a short description for each.

## Structure

- docs/admin.md — Admin panel technical overview and implementation notes (EN).
- docs/quiz-funnel.md — Quiz funnel design, tracking events, and implementation checklist (EN).
- QUICK_START.md — Repository quick start.
- DEPLOYMENT.md — Deployment notes.

## How to use

- For development onboarding, read `QUICK_START.md` then `docs/index.md` and `docs/admin.md` or `docs/quiz-funnel.md` depending on your task.
- When modifying or adding docs, prefer updating files under `docs/` and keeping top-level project README short and focused.

## Next steps

- Keep user-facing strings and product copy in English.
